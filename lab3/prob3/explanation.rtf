No, it does not make sense to use inheritance here because when Circle 
class inherits from Cylinder class, inside the Circle class constructor, 
we will be required to initialize a parameterized constructor  of cylinder 
which will change the value of height instance variable from cylinder class 
and the result of this, the computation of volume will be wrong. This is known as fragility.
