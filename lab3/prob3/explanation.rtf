No, it does not make sense to use inheritance here because when Circle 
class inherits from Cylinder class, inside the Circle class constructor, 
we will be required to initialize a parameterized constructor  of cylinder 
which will change the value of height instance variable from cylinder class 
and the result of this when a setter is used the computation of Area of Circle will be wrong. 
This is known as fragility.
